# Dog Breed Prediction

This project focuses on predicting dog breeds using deep learning techniques. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with the final trained model saved for inference. The implementation is done in Python with Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to follow and reproduce. The goal of the project is to classify different dog breeds accurately from images using a trained neural network.

##  Features
- Preprocessing of image data to prepare for model training.  
- Deep learning model training with real-time visualization using Jupyter Notebooks.  
- Model evaluation and inference saved as `.h5` for easy reuse.  

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive processing and model training.  
- **Python** for scripting and training.  
- **Deep Learning Framework** (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch) to train the model.  
*(Replace with actual framework you used.)*

##  Usage

1. **Preprocessing**  
   Open `Data_Preprocess.ipynb` to clean and format your dataset into `data.npy` and `target.npy`.

2. **Training**  
   Run `Training.ipynb` to train your model.  
   Output: `dog-breed-prediction.h5` or model checkpoint in `models/`.

3. **Evaluation & Testing**  
   Use `Testing.ipynb` to validate model performance with the test dataset.
